# config.yaml

## parameters

-   clustalo: the name of the clustalomega command on your system (e.g. clustalo)
-   multifata: /path/to the multifasta file to turn into an msa and use (e.g. resources/acehomologene.txt)
-   msa: /path/to the msa generated by clustalo or the one you already have (e.g. resources/msa.msa)
-   SNP: the SNP(s) you want to annotate write position: aminoacid (e.g. 11: L)

## SNP notation

as noted above the SNP are notated: `position: aminoacid` but if you want multiple SNPs to be annotated at the same time you can comma separate the notation `11: L, 89: A`. Furthermore the position starts counting from 1.
